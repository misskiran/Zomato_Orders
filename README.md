  * The convenience of ordering food from the comfort of home or the office, coupled with the availability of mobile apps and delivery services, made online ordering a popular choice for cafe patrons.
  * Factors like shorter wait times, the ability to customize orders, and the option to work or relax while waiting for food might also influence this trend.
